Creating your own custom domain email is simple, and relatively cheap. For programmers, and small businesses, I consider it a requirement. 

The Benefits of Custom Email Domains
Apart from offering customization options and allowing you to create multiple email addresses for various departments and individuals associated with your business, these are the expected benefits of a custom email domain:

It promotes brand marketing:You can add customized email addresses to your website, social media accounts, business cards and employee email signatures. That‚Äôs an easy way to market your brand.

It enhances your credibility: A custom email domain gives your business more credibility. It helps you look more professional to customers. And that strengthens their trust in your brand, making them more likely to make another purchase.

It gives you consistency:With a custom email domain, you‚Äôll get consistency across various channels. You can create multiple addresses for specific roles such as support and sales, and customers can easily remember the formula for your business email addresses and contact you when necessary.

It provides an extra layer of security: Public email addresses are often prone to security breaches. But with a custom email domain, you have lower chances of data leaks or hacks, which keeps your data safe. Your data is more secure because of the enhanced encryptions and security measures, such as SSL certificates, which are available for custom email domains.
It gives you control: Owning a custom email domain means creating as many emails as you want and maintaining your domain name. Also, you can access and monitor emails. For instance, if a hiring manager leaves your company, the new employee can access necessary data.

## Prerequisites
- Your own domain, ie. Riley-Fitz.com

## Time Requirement

- Domain Record Setup ~30mins
- Confirm it works ~10mins
- Proton Folder Setup ~30mins

##### Total: 
**~3hours no domain in hand**

**~2hours domain in hand**


## Plan Comparisons

I personally recommend Proton Mail to use as your Custom Domain. Its competetive price, extensive additional features, and focus on privacy makes it a top contender. However, there are many providers offering custom domain email service, and you will need to decide who to use. 

Remember this will probably be in place for a long time, and conversions to another platform will not be simple. As such choose a provider you are happy to stick with.

### Popular Choices
- **[Proton Mail](https://proton.me/business/plans) $7/Month**

## Setting Domain Records
### ProtonMail shout out
I have chosen Protonmail for my email service provider. It offers far more meaingful products, such as cloud storage, VPN usage, and a robust password manager. Alongside anouncing a non-profit structure bousting privacy

## For Protonmail set up 




## Confirming its functioning

It can take upto 24hours for the record to take effect. Take a break.

After some time use an existing email, to send a test email to your new account with your custom domain.
-ie. MeMyselfAndI@MyOwnDomain.com

If not recieved in a few minutes, reviews steps and try again. Otherwise, reply to your test email, and verify it gets delivered back.

## Now you are finished!

You can continue to optimize your email by moving onto the next blog. This covers setting up additional addresses, and creating filters folders to organize these different email accounts.

Enjoy your new custom domain email üéâüéâ
